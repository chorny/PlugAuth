=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin provides a user list, stored as a flat file.  It just provides a user list,
no authentication.  All authentication requests are passed onto the next authentication
plugin in your configuration.  The intent of this plugin is to provide a user list for
authentication plugins which do not otherwise provide a user list (The above example
shows how to configure this plugin with the L<LDAP|PlugAuth::Plugin::LDAP> plugin as
an example).

The format of the user list is a simple text file, one line per user.  Do not use
spaces, comments, tabs or anything like that as they are not supported.  This plugin
does NOT support modifying the user list through the PlugAuth RESTful API.  You will
need to hand edit the user list to add and remove users.

L<PlugAuth> needs an accurate user list to compute the list of groups and to handle
authorization, as there is a special group for each user that contains exactly just
that user and has the same name as that user.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $plugin-E<gt>check_credentials( $user, $pass )

Check if the username and password is a valid credentials.  This plugin just passes
the request on to the next authentication plugin without checking the username or 
password.

=head2 $plugin-E<gt>all_users

Returns the list of users in the user list file.
